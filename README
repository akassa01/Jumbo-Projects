lineage.cpp

The code runs with the command a.out < sampleC.data (or sampleD.data)
Given a database of genes and mutations (as provided in Sample A and B data), the code has a series of functions:

"e" followed by two genes eg. e TTAC TTAT will print a message telling you if 
the given evolution is possible

"es" followed by two genes eg. es TTAC TTAT will print a message telling you 
how many steps there are to evolve from one to another

"ene" followed by two genes and a number eg. ene TTAC TTAT will print a message 
telling you if that evolution is possible with the given energy amount

"path" followed by two genes eg. path TTAC TTAT will print the evolution path 
between the two genes complete with all genes in between
